        The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the
        Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built
        the tower from 1887 to 1889.The tower is 330 metres about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the
        tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres on each side. During its construction, the
        Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title
        it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first
        structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a
        broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres. Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after
        the Millau Viaduc</p>
