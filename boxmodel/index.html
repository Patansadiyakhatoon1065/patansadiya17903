        <p>Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human activities.
            The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several delicacies to
            enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts
            from nature. Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature.
